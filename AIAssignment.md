## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.

I was having trouble testing my backend code, so I asked AI for help with some errors I was getting that I didn't understand.

AI transcript:
The key part of the error is:

TypeError: argument handler must be a function
at app.post in src/index.ts:20:5

That means on this line (or similar):

app.post('/token', ???);


the second argument is not a function. It might be undefined, an object, or the result of calling a function instead of the function itself.

Let’s fix that by making sure your /token handler and imports are set up correctly.

1. Make sure auth.ts exports a real function
Key points:

export function tokenHandler(...) → this is a plain function

export function authMiddleware(...) → also a function

No export default { ... } nonsense that would give you an object instead of a function.

2. Make sure index.ts imports and uses it correctly
3. Quick checklist

auth.ts has named exports:

export function tokenHandler(...) { ... }
export function authMiddleware(...) { ... }


index.ts imports named:

import { authMiddleware, tokenHandler } from './auth';


You pass the function, not call it:

app.post('/token', tokenHandler);

### Part 2

> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?
Yes, I was not understanding some of the errors I was getting, so I asked AI to help me interpret the errors and give suggestions on how to move forward. Traditional search engines can't take a look at the exact error I am getting, so asking AI was more efficient.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?
I think AI answered my question properly.

### Part 4

> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
